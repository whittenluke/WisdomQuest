# WisdomQuest: Game Design Document

## 1. Vision & Scope

### Core Concept
WisdomQuest is an enchanting open-world game where players can master various knowledge areas, with each mastery visibly changing both their character and their abilities to interact with the world.

### Key Features
* Open-world exploration
* Multiple knowledge areas to master
* Character evolution based on learned knowledge
* Questing system tied to knowledge acquisition
* Flexible gameplay allowing for both focused learning and free exploration

### Future Possibilities
* Expanded knowledge areas (e.g., science, art, engineering, astronomy)
* Combining knowledge from different areas for unique abilities
* Advanced character customization based on learned skills
* Multiplayer and community features
* AI-driven adaptive learning content

## 2. Design Principles
* **Scalability:** All systems should be designed to easily accommodate future expansions
* **Modularity:** Components should be self-contained and easily interchangeable
* **Clarity:** Code and systems should be well-documented and easily understandable
* **Performance:** The game should maintain high performance even as complexity increases

## 3. MVP Technical Foundation

### Core Systems

#### 1. Player System
```csharp
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Handle movement, interaction, and camera control
}

public class PlayerData : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Store player stats, inventory, and progress
}
```

#### 2. Knowledge System
```csharp
public class KnowledgeManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Manage acquisition and storage of knowledge pieces
}

public class KnowledgePiece : ScriptableObject
{
    // Define properties of individual knowledge pieces
}
```

#### 3. Quest System
```csharp
public class QuestManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Handle quest assignment, tracking, and completion
}

public class Quest : ScriptableObject
{
    // Define quest properties and rewards
}
```

#### 4. Interaction System
```csharp
public interface IInteractable
{
    void Interact(PlayerController player);
}

public class InteractionManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Manage player interactions with the world
}
```

#### 5. Save System
```csharp
public class SaveManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Handle saving and loading game state
}
```

#### 6. UI System
```csharp
public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Manage all UI elements and interactions
}
```

### MVP Scene: Library of Light

#### Environment
* **Dimensions:** 50x50 units
* **Areas:**
  * Central reading area
  * Knowledge area selection zone
  * Quest board
  * Exit to future open world

#### Interactions
* Knowledge area selection
* Basic quest acceptance
* Dialogue with one NPC librarian

## 4. Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Core Framework
* Set up project in Unity 2022.3.51f1 LTS
* Implement basic PlayerController with movement and camera
* Create KnowledgeManager and KnowledgePiece classes
* Develop simple QuestManager and Quest classes

### Phase 2: Library of Light Scene
* Build basic Library of Light environment
* Implement InteractionManager
* Create NPC with basic dialogue system
* Set up knowledge area selection interface

### Phase 3: Game Loop
* Implement quest acceptance and tracking
* Create simple knowledge piece acquisition system
* Develop basic UI for player status and inventory
* Implement SaveManager for basic game state persistence

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing
* Refine player movement and camera controls
* Enhance UI and add basic tutorials
* Implement simple sound effects and background music
* Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing

## 5. Extensibility Points

### Knowledge Areas
* Design KnowledgeArea class to be easily expandable
* Create a modular quest generation system for each area

### Character Evolution
* Implement a flexible character modification system
* Design visual changes to be tied to knowledge levels

### World Expansion
* Plan for seamless integration of new areas beyond the Library
* Design modular environment pieces for easy world-building

## 6. Unity Best Practices
* Use ScriptableObjects for data-driven design (quests, knowledge pieces)
* Implement the Observer pattern for event-driven programming
* Utilize Unity's new Input System for better input handling
* Use addressables for efficient asset management
* Implement object pooling for performance optimization

## 7. Testing Milestones
* Player Movement and Interaction
* Knowledge Area Selection
* Quest Acceptance and Tracking
* Knowledge Piece Acquisition
* Save/Load Functionality

## 8. MVP Completion Criteria
* Player can move and interact in the Library of Light
* At least one knowledge area is selectable
* Player can accept and complete a basic quest
* Knowledge pieces can be acquired and stored
* Game state can be saved and loaded
* Basic UI provides necessary player feedback

*This document provides a clear path for MVP development while laying the groundwork for future expansion. It focuses on creating a solid, extensible foundation in Unity, allowing for the gradual implementation of more complex features as the project evolves.*
